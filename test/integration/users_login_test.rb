  # the process is listed below
  # 1. Visit the login path.
  # 2. Verify that the new sessions form renders properly.
  # 3. Post to the sessions path with an invalid params hash.
  # 4. Verify that the new sessions form gets re-rendered and that a flash message appears.
  # 5. Visit another page (such as the Home page).
  # 6. Verify that the flash message doesnâ€™t appear on the new page.

  # the flow will be the following:
  # 1. Visit the login path.
  # 2. Post valid information to the sessions path.
  # 3. Verify that the login link disappears.
  # 4. Verify that a logout link appears
  # 5. Verify that a profile link appears.
