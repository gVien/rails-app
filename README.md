# Ruby on Rails Course

This is a great 12-chapter course on Ruby on Rails. <b>It is one of the few courses that includes test driven development, as all features are taught with test driven development in mind.</b> Anyone with varying experience level can take away from this course and I had a lot of fun completing it (especially the TDD part). <b>My rails and web development skills have improved greatly after completing this course</b>. Highly recommended to anyone who is new to Rails or wants to learn the advanced Rails concepts (such as following users feature).
